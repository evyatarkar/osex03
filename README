REMARKS:
- in the shuffle phase to be most efficient we decided to find the max key and according to it iterate
through all thread vectors and create a vector with this key. we made sure we popped all the pairs with the current max
key. Because the vectors are sorted it guaranties that the max element will be at the end and we don't need to look for
them through the whole vector.
-  we used atomic counter for all the phases in order to calculate the percentage correctly.
